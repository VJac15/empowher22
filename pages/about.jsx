      <p>Despite a growing number of computer science jobs, women only earn 18% of computer science bachelor's degrees in the United States. This disparity can be attributed to a lack of female mentors/role models and an intimidation factor that comes from the belief that prior experience is necessary for participation. We aim to give young women the opportunity to hone their technical skills in an inclusive environment!</p>
